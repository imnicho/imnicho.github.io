# Dreamscapes & Conscious Escapes

Lately, I've ventured into lucid dreaming and astral projection—realities within realities. Strange lands await each night, places where the laws of physics are optional.

Here’s the deal:

- Meditation: Gateway to the unconscious.
- Lucid Dreams: Your playground, your rules.
- Astral Projection: TBD—still decoding that one.

Journey updates coming when the morning arrives.
